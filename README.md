# Motivation

Coming from [this](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html#note-on-relationships) redux statement: 

> Note on Relationships

> In a more complex app, you’re going to want different entities to reference each other. We suggest that you keep your state as normalized as possible, without any nesting. Keep every entity in an object stored with an ID as a key, and use IDs to reference it from other entities, or lists. Think of the app’s state as a database. This approach is described in normalizr's documentation in detail. For example, keeping todosById: { id -> todo } and todos: array<id> inside the state would be a better idea in a real app, but we’re keeping the example simple.

And because it is [hard](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/jbh50-GJxpg) to consume data from nested API responses. You would like to have a normalized Api or normalize it with [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)

So we think that normalized api's are here to stay... but, is very difficult to recreate all of these relations in our client-side app... This is why model-environment was created for.

Have you ever wanted to do things like: `user.company().employees()` in your client-side app?

# Requirements

To have a normalized api (or normalize it), which provides of data with the following structure (we are currently working in the array version):
```javascript
{
  objects: {
    modelOneObjects: {
      1: {},
      2: {},
      ...
    },
    modelTwoObjects: {
      1: {},
      2: {},
      ...
    },
  },
}
```

# Installation: 

```bash
npm install --save model-enviroment
```

# Usage: 

```javascript
import { Model } from 'model-enviroment';
import { Environment } from 'model-enviroment';
import * as Models from 'path/to/your/models/index';
```

Declare your models

```javascript
class ModelOne {
  ...
}
class ModelTwo {
  ...
}
```

When you first load your data, update it (or in your component render view if you are using redux, or in your respective selector if you are using them wisely):

```javascript
import * as Models from 'path/to/your/models/index'
const env = new Environment({this.props.objects}, Models).parseDB()
```
Then you can do:
```javascript
env.objects.parsedModelOneObjects[1]
```
or

```javascript
env.objects.parsedModelOneObjects[1].env().ModelTwo.findBy('modelOneId', 2);
```

You can also define relations on your models as this:
On ModelTwo.js

```javascript
modelOneObject() {
  return this.env().ModelOne.getById(this.modelOneId);
}
```

Or if it is a many to many relation:
```javascript
modelOneObjects() {
  let array = [];
  let thisRef = this;

  return this.modelOneIds.map((modelOneId) => {
    return thisRef.env().ModelOne.getById(modelOneId);
  });
}
```

# Notes

## Names are important
If you are passing the users objects like these:

```javascript
{
  objects: {
    users: {
      1: {
        email: "tomas@tcit.cl"
        name: "Tomás"
      },
      2: {
        email: "felipe@tcit.cl"
        name: "Felipe"
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Then your Models index must export the same names, or a warning will show on console remembering you that.
Also, the searcher methods for relations will have those names.

## Similarities with [redux-orm](https://github.com/tommikaikkonen/redux-orm)

### We focus
On translating a normalized api into objects that are built from classes that have relations between each other.

### The **most important** 
And remarkable difference is that model-environment is not coupled to redux, so you can use it with angular, angular2, backbone, ember, etc...
This also allows you to update your state as you would do it naturally with redux.

# From our experience
We use this library already on four project in our [company](http://www.tcit.cl/) and what we are most impressed about it is:
1. Performance: At the beggining we were afraid of how much would it take to re build the whole environment each time we update the state, even more if you have your form controls binded with the state, but it performed perfectly
2. **Api reusability**: After you have defined your models and learned how to build a normalized api, you will be impressed how agnostic your views can get from your backend relations, you just pass the data normalized and your environment re-uses all your previously defined relations, after you experience this you will be impressed
3. Performance of using normalized apis: Fetching your data into nested objects is awfull, long, and tedious. Is much easier (after you learn), and you automatically are eager loading your data! No awfull prefetching code (take a look at rails `includes` or django's `prefetch`)!. Most of our apps are backed up in Rails, so we can give you a sample of how we do it (Should be very easy to replicate in Node):

```ruby
causes = Cause.all
causes_ids = causes.map(&:id)
veredicts = Veredict.where("cause_id IN (?)", causes_ids).to_a
parties_ids = causes.map(&:issuer_party_id) + causes.map(&:receiver_party_id)
parties = Party.where("id IN (?)", parties_ids).to_a

causes_hash = ApiNormalization.get_objects_hash causes
veredicts_hash = ApiNormalization.get_objects_hash veredicts
parties_hash = ApiNormalization.get_objects_hash parties

data = {
  objects:{
    causes: causes_hash,
    veredicts: veredicts_hash,
    parties: parties_hash,
  }
}

render json: data
```

If you are interested in `ApiNormalization.get_objects_hash` please write us so we can publish that module, but basically it maps a hash with each object id as it key and the object's data as the value.

# What we would love to try

**Universal apps built with these models!** So you can share your relations between your client and server side logic.

# Searcher methods api
Finder methods:
1. Model.getById()
2. Model.findBy()
3. Model.findAllBy()
4. Model.all()

Others:
1. Model.getClassPluralizedName()
2. Model.getClassObjects()
3. Model.getThisClass()

# To be done:

1. Somehow declare the relation name as: belongs_to or has_many to automatically expose the relations
2. Implement more finderMethods: where, etc... are these really important?
3. Allow for objects coming from api as arrays instead of objects: [obj1, obj2, obj3] instead of {1: obj1, 2: obj2, 3: obj3}
4. Optimize Environment creation with reselect?
