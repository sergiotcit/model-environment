Super lightweight environment that permits to define relations between objects when receiving objects from normalized api's

# Motivation

Coming from this redux statement:

> Note on Relationships

> In a more complex app, you’re going to want different entities to reference each other. We suggest that you keep your state as normalized as possible, without any nesting. Keep every entity in an object stored with an ID as a key, and use IDs to reference it from other entities, or lists. Think of the app’s state as a database. This approach is described in normalizr's documentation in detail. For example, keeping todosById: { id -> todo } and todos: array<id> inside the state would be a better idea in a real app, but we’re keeping the example simple.

But, we all know that is very difficult to recreate all of this relations in our client-side app... This is why model-environment was created for.

# Requirements: To have a normalized api, which provides adata with the following structure:
```javascript
{objects: {
    modelOneObjects: {
      1: {},
      2: {},
      ...
    }
    modelTwoObjects: {
      1: {},
      2: {},
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

# Installation: 

```bash
npm install --save model-enviroment
```

# Usage: 

```javascript
import ModelEnvironment from 'model-enviroment';
import * as Models from 'path/to/your/models/index';
```

All of your models must extend from Model

```javascript
import ModelEnvironment from 'model-enviroment';
class ModelOne extends ModelEnvironment.Model {
  ...
}
class ModelTwo extends ModelEnvironment.Model {
  ...
}
```

In your component render view

```javascript
import * as Models from 'path/to/your/models/index'
conts env = new Environment({this.props.objects}, Models).parseDB
```
Then you can do:
```javascript
env.objects.parsedModelOneObjects[1]
```
or

```javascript
env.objects.parsedModelOneObjects[1].env().ModelTwo.findBy('modelOneId', 2);
```

You can also define relations on your models as this:
On ModelTwo.js

```javascript
modelOneObject() {
  return this.env().ModelOne.getById(this.modelOneId);
}
```

Or if it is a many to many relation:
```javascript
modelOneObjects() {
  let array = [];
  let thisRef = this;

  return this.modelOneIds.map((modelOneId) => {
    return thisRef.env().ModelOne.getById(modelOneId);
  });
}
```

Model static methods api:
Finder methods:
getById
findBy
all

Others:
getClassPluralizedName
getClassObjects
getThisClass

To be done:

1. Somehow declare the relation name as: belongs_to or has_many to automatically expose the relations
2. Implement more finderMethods: findAllBy, etc...
3. Allow for objects coming from api as arrays instead of objects: [obj1, obj2, obj3] instead of {1: obj1, 2: obj2, 3: obj3}
